# GenerativeAI
Generative AI is artificial intelligence capable of generating text, images, or other data using generative models often in response to prompts. Generative AI models learn the patterns and structure of their input training data and then generate new data with similar characteristics.

## Language Generation

Large Language Models (LLMs) are artificial neural networks, the largest and most capable, built with a transformer-based architecture. LLMs can perform general-purpose language generation based on using computationally intensive self-supervised and semi-supervised training processes.
Examples: LLM chatbots such as OpenAI ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Google Bard, and Meta LLaMA

### LangChain
[LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain) is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. It enables applications to be context-aware by connecting a language model to sources of context like prompts. 

## Text to Image Generation
A text-to-image model is a machine learning model that takes an input natural language description and produces an image matching that description. Such Generative AI models generally use Diffusion models for this process.
Examples: Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, and DALL-E.
